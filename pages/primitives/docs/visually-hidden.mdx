## API Reference

### VisuallyHidden

`VisuallyHidden` is the root component. Anything you put inside `VisuallyHidden` will be hidden from the screen but will be announced by screen readers.

This is useful in certain scenarios as an alternative to traditional labelling with `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
