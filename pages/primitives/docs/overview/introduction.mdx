Radix Primitives is a low-level component library with a focus on accessibility, customisation and developer experience.

You can use these components as the base layer of your design system or just as a one off solution.

With Radix Primitives, you'll be able to implement complex UI Components in minutes, such as a [custom select](https://modulz.app/blog/under-the-spotlight-select).

### Key Features

#### Accessibility

Building accessible components is a highly demanding task. There are many things to take into consideration, from screen reader support to keyboard navigation.

We ensure that all components adhere to the [WAI-ARAI design pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2) when possible. Giving you a piece of mind and allowing you to focus on the UI.

Learn more in the [accessibility](./accessibility) page.

#### Styling

All components ship without any CSS, giving you have full control over its look and feel. They work with CSS-in-JS libraries, such as Stitches, or with CSS preprocessors such as Sass.

All components and their relevant parts contain data attributes to be used as selectors. Stateful components also expose their current state via these attributes.

Learn more in the [styling](./styling) page.

#### Customisation

The Radix Primitives components were designed to be customised to suit your needs.

Some components also accept configurational props. For example, you can choose whether the [Popover](../components/popover) appears below or above its trigger.

You have access to every part a component depends on. For example, when building a [Tooltip](../components/tooltip), you can access the `Trigger`, `Content` and `Arrow` parts. Having access to all the granular parts of a component gives you a large amount of flexibility to wrap them, add your own event listeners, add your own props or your own refs.

#### Uncontrolled by default

When applicable, all components are uncontrolled, but can optionally be controlled if needed. All the behaviour wiring is handled internally, so you can get up and running as smoothly as possible.

For example, implementing a fully functioning [Dialog](../components/dialog) component doesn't require you to create any local states and update accordingly.

#### Developer Experience

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. Radix Primitives provides a fully-typed API. All components share a similar API, creating a consitent and predictable experience.

Also, when using the `as` prop, the prop suggestions will update. Truly polymorphic.

#### Incremental adoption

Each primitive can be installed indivudually so you can incrementally adopt them over time.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-tooltip
```

Please refer to each primitive's documentation for installation instructions.

### A quick tutorial

Let's take a few minutes to install a Dropdown Menu component, style it, and package it as your own.

**Note:** This example uses [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) but any styling solution is [compatible](./styling).

#### 1. Install

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
```

#### 2. Create your Dropdown Menu file

```jsx live manual
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as DropdownMenuPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu';

const DropdownTrigger = styled(DropdownMenuPrimitive.Trigger, {
  backgroundColor: 'hsl(252,78%,71%)',
  borderRadius: 6,
  lineHeight: '1',
  fontWeight: 500,
  padding: '10px 15px',
  border: 'none',

  '&:hover': { backgroundColor: 'hsl(252,78%,60%)' },
});

const DropdownContent = styled(DropdownMenuPrimitive.Content, {
  minWidth: 130,
  backgroundColor: 'hsl(252,50%,10%)',
  borderRadius: 6,
  padding: 5,
  boxShadow: '0px 5px 15px -5px hsla(206,22%,7%,.15)',
});

const DropdownItem = styled(DropdownMenuPrimitive.Item, {
  fontSize: 13,
  padding: '5px 10px',
  borderRadius: 3,
  cursor: 'default',
  color: 'white',

  '&:focus': {
    outline: 'none',
    backgroundColor: 'hsl(252,78%,71%)',
    color: 'white',
  },
});

export default () => (
  <DropdownMenuPrimitive.Root>
    <DropdownTrigger>Trigger</DropdownTrigger>
    <DropdownContent sideOffset={5}>
      <DropdownItem>Undo</DropdownItem>
      <DropdownItem>Redo</DropdownItem>
      <DropdownItem>Cut</DropdownItem>
      <DropdownItem>Copy</DropdownItem>
      <DropdownItem>Paste</DropdownItem>
    </DropdownContent>
  </DropdownMenuPrimitive.Root>
);
```
