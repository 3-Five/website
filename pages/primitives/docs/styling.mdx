## Overview

Radix Primitives are unstyled and unopinionated about styles by default. You shoul be able to style our components the same way you would any other component that renders elements to the DOM.

## Functional Styles

For many components, there are some basic styles needed for basic functionality. Where it makes sense, we apply many computed styles inline, but in general we avoid this for a few reasons. Inline styles are difficult to override in other styling contexts, and in many cases there are ways to add these functional styles differently than we might prescribe them.

We don't expose any external stylesheets or JavaScript styling objects because Primitives exist without any knowledge of how they might be styled. As such, we provide examples in each component's documentation as a guide for which functional styles you may want to apply as a starting point for your design system.

## CSS selectors

As a general rule, most Primitives components that render to the DOM only render one DOM element. In all components that render to the DOM, an element will have a data attribute namespaced with `radix` that matches the name of the component, but as a kebab-cased string.

For example, [`DialogContent`](https://radix-ui.vercel.app/primitives/docs/components/dialog#content) will render an element with a `data-radix-dialog-content` attribute. [`DialogOverlay`](https://radix-ui.vercel.app/primitives/docs/components/dialog#overlay) will render an element with a `data-radix-dialog-overlay` attribute.

You can target these elements in plain CSS directly using attribute selectors.

```css
[data-radix-dialog-content] {
  color: var(--color-black);
}

[data-radix-dialog-overlay] {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```

If a component renders multiple DOM elements, as is the case with [`ScrollAreaViewport`](https://radix-ui.vercel.app/primitives/docs/components/scroll-area#viewport), elements that are not directly exposed with a custom component are considered implementation details and should generally not be styled directly, though we do add similar data attributes to those elements as an escape hatch. Use these with caution, and if you cannot style a component as expected without accessing hidden functional elements, we encourage you to [open an issue](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues) instead so we can provide alternative solutions or update our API to accommodate these needs.

### The `data-state` selector

For stateful components, we generally provide a `data-state` attribute on elements to target elements in a specific state. For example, an [`AccordionButton`](https://radix-ui.vercel.app/primitives/docs/components/accordion#button) component may be styled differently when its [`AccordionItem`](https://radix-ui.vercel.app/primitives/docs/components/accordion#item) is `open` than when it is `closed`. You can target the button in its `open` state directly using `data-state`:

```css
[data-radix-accordion-button] {
  color: var(--color-black);
}

[data-radix-accordion-button][data-state='open'] {
  color: var(--color-blue);
}
```

### CSS Classnames

We do not add `className` properties to elements by default, but any props passed to a component that renders an element will be passed through to the underlying JSX component. This means you can add a `className` to any component and use it in CSS as expected.

```js
<AccordionButton className="hello">Hello</AccordionButton>
```

```css
.hello {
  color: var(--color-black);
}

.hello[data-state='open'] {
  color: var(--color-blue);
}
```

## CSS-in-JS

Radix Primitives can be styled with any CSS-in-JS library of your choosing, using the same APIs those libraries would provide for styling any custom component.

### Stitches

For example, if you are using [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/), you could add styles to a primitive `AccordionButton` using the `styled` or `css` utilities returned from `createStyled`:

```js
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';
import { createStyled } from '@stitches/react';

export const { styled, css } = createStyled({
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      $white: '#fff',
      $gray100: '#ccc',
      $gray300: '#aaa',
      $black: '#111',
      $blue: 'royalblue',
    },
  },
});

const AccordionButton = styled(AccordionPrimitive.Button, {
  boxSizing: 'border-box',
  width: '100%',
  textAlign: 'inherit',
  appearance: 'none',
  border: 'none',
  backgroundColor: '$white',
  color: '$black',

  '&:disabled': {
    color: '$gray300',
  },

  '&[data-state="open"]': {
    color: '$blue',
  },
});
```

### Styled Components or Emotion

[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) have similar APIs with the `styled` function. You can pass styles to any primitve using either the JS object or string literal syntax:

```js
import * as AccordionPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-accordion';
import styled from '@emotion/styled'; // Or: import styled from '@emotion/styled'

const AccordionButton = styled(AccordionPrimitive.Button)`
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 100%;
  text-align: inherit;
  appearance: none;
  border: none;
  background-color: var(--color-white);
  color: var(--color-black);

  &:disabled {
    color: var(--color-gray-300);
  }

  &[data-state='open'] {
    color: var(--color-blue);
  }
`;
```
