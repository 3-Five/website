Radix Primitives are built to provide a solid foundation for your design system.

With these low-level tools, you'll be able to implement complex, highly usable UI components—that would otherwise take a team of developers months to build—in minutes.

## Key Features

### Accessible

Building accessible components is a highly demanding task. There are many things to take into consideration, from screen reader support to keyboard navigation.

We ensure that all components adhere to the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2) when possible, giving you piece-of-mind that components are broadly accessible by default, and allowing you to focus on the UI. Accessible components alone cannot guarantee an accessible application, but they do make the job much simpler elsewhere in your codebase.

Learn more in the [accessibility](./accessibility) page.

### Unstyled

All components ship without any CSS, giving you have full control over the look and feel. They work with CSS-in-JS libraries, such as [Stitches](https: //stitches.dev), or with CSS preprocessors such as Sass.

Learn more in the [styling](./styling) page.

### Opened

The Radix Primitives components were designed to be customised to suit your needs.

You have access to every part a component depends on. For example, when building a [Tooltip](./tooltip), you can access the `Trigger`, `Content` and `Arrow` parts directly. Having access to all the granular parts of a component gives you a large amount of flexibility to wrap them, add your own event listeners, add your own props, and build whatever API you'd like for your own design system.

Some components also accept configuration props. For example, you can choose whether the [Popover](./popover) appears below or above its trigger.

### Uncontrolled

Just like in [native React form fields](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html), stateful Primitives uncontrolled by default but can optionally be controlled if needed. All the behaviour wiring is handled internally, so you can get up and running as smoothly as possible.

For example, implementing a fully functioning [Dialog](./dialog) component doesn't require you to create any local state for basic functionality.

### Pleasant

One of our main goals is to provide the best possible developer experience. Radix Primitives provide a fully-typed API. All components share a similar API, creating a consitent and predictable experience.

Also, when using the `as` prop, the prop suggestions and type inferences will update accordingly. Truly polymorphic.

### Incremental

Each primitive can be installed indivudually so you can incrementally adopt them over time.

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu
npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-tooltip
```

Please refer to each primitive's documentation for installation instructions.

## A quick tutorial

Let's take a few minutes to install, style, and create a Popover Component, powered by the [Popover Primitive](./popover).

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-popover
```

### 2. Expose

Import and export the parts. Add styles where desired.

**Note:** This example uses [Stitches](https://stitches.dev) but any styling solution is [compatible](./styling).

```jsx
// Popover.tsx
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as PopoverPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-popover';

export const Popover = PopoverPrimitive.Root;
export const PopoverTrigger = PopoverPrimitive.Trigger;
export const PopoverContent = styled(PopoverPrimitive.Content, {...});
```

### 3. Use it

```jsx
// App.tsx
import {
  Popover,
  PopoverTrigger,
  PopoverContent,
} from 'your-components/Popover';

function App() {
  return (
    <Popover>
      <PopoverTrigger>...</PopoverTrigger>
      <PopoverContent>...</PopoverContent>
    </Popover>
  );
}
```

## Demo

```jsx live manual compact
import { styled } from 'path-to/stitches.config';
import * as PopoverPrimitive from '@radix-ui/react-popover';

const Popover = PopoverPrimitive.Root;
const PopoverTrigger = PopoverPrimitive.Trigger;
const PopoverContent = styled(PopoverPrimitive.Content, {
  backgroundColor: 'white',
  borderRadius: 6,
  boxShadow: '0px 10px 38px -10px hsla(206,22%,7%,.35)',
  overflow: 'hidden',

  '&:focus': {
    outline: 'none',
    boxShadow: '0 0 0 3px hsl(272,100%,96%)',
  },
});

// Other components in your App
const Box = styled('div', {});
const Text = styled('div', {
  fontSize: 16,
});
const Button = styled('button', {
  appearance: 'none',
  border: 'none',
  backgroundColor: 'transparent',
  border: '1px solid hsl(272,68%,70%)',
  color: 'hsl(272,62%,44%)',
  padding: '5px 15px',
  borderRadius: 4,

  '&:focus': {
    outline: 'none',
    boxShadow: '0 0 0 3px hsl(272,100%,96%)',
  },
});

export default () => (
  <Popover>
    <PopoverTrigger as={Button}>Trigger</PopoverTrigger>
    <PopoverContent sideOffset={3}>
      <Box css={{ width: 320 }}>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596420667316-cb2b4f67fc6d?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2250&q=80" />
        <Box css={{ padding: 20 }}>
          <Text css={{ fontWeight: 500 }}>Brian Lundquist</Text>
          <Text
            css={{
              margin: '5px 0 15px',
              color: 'slategray',
              fontSize: 14,
            }}
          >
            @bwl667
          </Text>
          <Button css={{ width: '100%' }}>Download</Button>
        </Box>
      </Box>
    </PopoverContent>
  </Popover>
);
```

## Conclusion

The steps above are generally what it takes to use a Radix Primitive in your application.

These components are low-level enough giving you control to choose how you want to wrap them. You're free to introduce your own high-level API to better suit your team's and product's needs.

In a few simple steps, we've implemented a fully accessible Popover component, without having to worry about many of its complexities.

- Adheres to [WAI-ARIA authoring practices guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#dialog_modal)
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled
- Customise side, alignment, offsets, collision handling
- Optionally render a pointing arrow
- Focus is fully managed and customisable
- Dismissing and layering behavior is highly customisable
